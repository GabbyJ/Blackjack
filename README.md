<p>Took me awhile, but I created Blackjack. It's a game I've wanted to do for awhile but haven't had the skills yet... now I do!</p>

<p>View <a href= "https://gabbyj.github.io/Blackjack/" target="_blank">Blackjack</a> here.</p>

<p>This helped me with better understanding flexbox and the DOM and I learned about async to create the bot playing.</p>

<p>Created Using</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to improve soon...</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Ace card plays 1 or 11 when needed, but it doesn't adjust from 11 to 1 when needed. I attempted it, and it kind of worked, but for some reason it occasionally glitched and seemed to include face cards I think. But I'm not positive. And if that is the case, I have no idea why.</li>
  <li>The other thing I need to do is refactor. I haven't really done it much in the past, but I know there's some "junk" in there that needs to be removed/editted.</li>
</ol>
